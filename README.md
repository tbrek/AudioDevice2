How many times have you played Jason Donovan trough your speakers instead of headphones embarrassing yourself?

This comes as a little helper. It's small menu bar application which shows current output device.

After re-writing the app from the scratch it become replacement for macOS' volume menu. It now can:

1. Change output device
2. Change input device
3. Adjust volume using slider
4. Show volume bar including mute state
5. Show/hide input device
6. Show/hide output device
7. Autopause Spotify/iTunes when screen is locked/unlocked
8. Display and control Spotify i Tunes
9. Display Airpods battery level.

When display names are too long and take too much space you can `use short names` option from app's preferences.
