# AudioDevice2

How many times have you play music trough you speakers instead of headphones?

This comes as a little helper. It's small menu bar application which shows current output device.

After re-writing the app from the scratch it become replacement for macOS' volume menu. It now can:

1. Change output device
2. Change input device
3. Adjust volume using slider
4. Show volume bar including mute state
5. Show/hide input device
6. Show/hide output device

When display names are too long and take too much space you can `use short names` option from app's preferences.
